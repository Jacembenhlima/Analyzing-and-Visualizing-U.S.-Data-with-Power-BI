## The idea

This project was developed as part of the edX course "Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Power BI." It focuses on importing, transforming, and modeling data, along with creating dynamic reports and dashboards based on U.S. data. The interactive visualizations built in this project demonstrate key data analytics skills, with applications in finance and other fields. It showcases how to leverage Power BI for real-time insights and data-driven decision-making.


### The process

- Step 1 : Loading the Dataset
- Step 2 : Cleaning the Data
- Step 3 : Map Visualization by Census Region
        Map Creation: Add a Map visual in Power BI and drag   the State or Census Region data to the Location field.

Color-code the regions based on the Census Region category to visually differentiate them.

        Filtering: Create slicers (as shown on the left side) for users to filter the view by specifiic regions.

- Step 4 : Table of States by Census Division
- Data Transformation: Ensure that each state is associated with its corresponding census division (e.g., Pacific, Mountain, East North Central).
- Table Creation:
    - Insert a Table visual and include columns for Census Division, State, and State Abbreviation.
    - Ensure the table is sorted either alphabetically by state or by census division, based on your preference.

- Step 5 :  Bar Chart: States by Census Region
- Data Grouping: Group the states by their respective Census Region (South, Midwest, West, Northeast).
- Bar Chart Creation:
    - Add a Bar Chart visual and use the Census Region as the axis.
    - Use a count of states to populate the bars (drag the State field into the Values area).
    - Adjust the formatting (colors, labels) to match the color coding of regions, aligning with the map for visual consistency.
